# Transit
Software Engineering Group-Transit

Creates a map with pinpointed user location. This works by using a premade map library to display a map that we can use for our application.


Release Notes:

So far, we have implemented a working map with a pinpointed user location.
We need to look into the pinpointer not pinpointing the correct location.
